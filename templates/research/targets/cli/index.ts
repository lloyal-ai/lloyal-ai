/**
 * The CLI target — where your research harness runs in a terminal.
 *
 * Generated for you and rarely touched. It does four things: resolve the
 * resident reasoning model, provision the Services the enabled abilities declare (the
 * corpus/web abilities need a reranker → `provisionAbilityModels` resolves + loads it and
 * publishes it on `RerankerCtx`), build this harness's edge `Runner`, pick a
 * surface, and run your harness over it. The surface pick is the whole "one
 * harness, many targets" idea in miniature — the same `harness(ctx, events,
 * commands)` mounts on Ink (a terminal), `ipc` (when a desktop shell forks this
 * bin), or `ndjson` (a pipe), all over one binding.
 *
 * Both models are files in `models/<role>/`, resolved from `harness.yml` and —
 * on first run — fetched + digest-verified by the platform (`rig.resolveModel`),
 * with no API key. Drop your own `.gguf` into `models/llm/` (or point a `path:`
 * at one) to skip the fetch entirely.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT: reasoning.run @ main
