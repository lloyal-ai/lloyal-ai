 * Run ONE served Session end to end: provision its per-session reranker + ability
 * services (its OWN reranker KV context over the shared resident weights, so
 * tenant documents never cross the reranker context), build the served `Runner`,
 * publish it on `RunnerCtx`, and run the UNCHANGED `harness(...)` over this
 * Session. `provisionAbilityModels` reads the corpus/web abilities' static
 * `services: ['reranker']`, loads the reranker, and publishes it on `RerankerCtx`
 * in THIS scope — the scope `harness()` runs in, so `registry.enable` injects it.
 * The host `spawn`s this as the per-session child; its scope owns BOTH the
 * reranker resource (disposes on teardown) and the `RunnerCtx` binding, so N
 * sessions share no runner state and no native reranker context.
 *
 * `cfg.model.reranker` is `serve.ts`'s resolved (digest-verified) reranker path →
 * a `{path}` spec rig uses as-is (no re-fetch). `applyServedGpuEnv(cfg)` runs
 * FIRST so the reranker load below (rig has no loadOptions passthrough) rides the
 * same `LLOYAL_GPU` as the resident context.
 *
 * The last three params ARE the `harness(ctx, events, commands)` signature — the
 * driver forwards the `{context, uiChannel, commands}` it materialised for the host.
