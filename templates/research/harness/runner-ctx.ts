/**
 * The runner ↔ harness seam — this harness's OWN edge substrate.
 *
 * `harness(ctx, events, commands)` reads `RunnerCtx` for the edge-shell concerns
 * it cannot own: the persistent wind-down / cancel signals, the live resolved
 * config, config persistence, and the model-reload restart request. A target's
 * boot sets `RunnerCtx` before calling `harness`.
 *
 *   - cli   → {@link makeEdgeRunner}   (in-memory config, no-op reload, one boot)
 *   - web   → {@link makeServedRunner} (per-session, tenant-isolated)
 *
 * (The reranker is NOT a Runner concern: the boot's `provisionAbilityModels` reads
 * the enabled abilities' `services` and publishes the reranker on `RerankerCtx` in the
 * harness's scope — the same context `registry.enable` reads. So a harness that
 * outgrows this template gets the SAME platform contract: a reranker-less Runner +
 * `provisionAbilityModels` for services.)
 *
 * NOT a platform contract — `@lloyal-labs/host` speaks `ServedHarness`, never
 * `Runner`. This is the reference harness's private substrate, reproduced so the
 * template builds the pipeline itself.
