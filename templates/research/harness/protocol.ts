/**
 * The harness's wire vocabulary.
 *
 * Its `WorkflowEvent` union (down) + `Command` union (up) — the two halves of
 * the headless interface `harness(ctx, events, commands)` speaks — plus the
 * config *schema* a runner resolves and hands the harness. A host or surface
 * imports these to speak the protocol without depending on the UI.
 *
 * TYPES ONLY — this surface must stay `node:`-free so a browser/renderer surface
 * can import it for the plan/event types. The config *schema* it re-exports lives
 * in `./config-types.ts` (also node-free); the runner that resolves + holds that
 * config (`makeEdgeRunner` / `makeServedRunner` from `@lloyal-labs/rig`) is
 * node-side and set on `RunnerCtx` by a target's boot.
