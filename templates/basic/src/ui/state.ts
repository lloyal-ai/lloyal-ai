/**
 * How a view *accumulates* your events into renderable state.
 *
 * `reduce(state, event) → AppState` is a pure, node-free fold. It lives here —
 * not in the harness, not in a view — for two reasons:
 *   1. Only the small raw `WorkflowEvent` crosses a target boundary (IPC to
 *      the desktop window, wss to the browser); the growing transcript never
 *      does. So the fold has to happen in the *sink*. The harness stays a pure
 *      emitter; the renderer stays a pure sink.
 *   2. All three target views — the terminal (Ink), the desktop and the web
 *      (React) — import this ONE `reduce`. Node-free so every runtime can.
 *
 * `AppState` is a standard shape the generic auto-view knows how to render.
 * Grow it as your harness emits more events; add a `case` per event, keep the
 * fold immutable (new `Map` + new object only for what changed), and the views
 * update for free.
