/**
 * The web target's boot — the `serve/main.ts` of the canonical serving
 * architecture. It resolves the resident model, hands the harness to the host via
 * the DRIVER (`createServedHostDriver`), and stands up the `ws` front door.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and matches reasoning.run (the production reference):
 * the host (`@lloyal-labs/host`) imports no harness; the harness
 * (`harness/harness.ts`) imports no host; the DRIVER (`./driver.ts`) is the only
 * file that knows both — this boot just wires config + the socket to it. It's the
 * SAME `harness(ctx, events, commands)` the cli and desktop run; only the binding
 * (wss, here) differs.
 *
 * `npm run serve` builds + starts this; then `npm run dev:web` serves the browser
 * ability that talks to it. Config from `harness.yml` + env (PORT / HOST /
 * MAX_SESSIONS). Loopback + no-auth for local dev — TLS/auth terminate upstream.
