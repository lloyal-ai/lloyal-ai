/**

 * into UI state via `reduce` (see `state.ts`). Grow these two types as your
 * harness grows; nothing else in the project needs to change when you do.
 *
 * `WorkflowEvent` re-exports the framework's `AgentEvent` because the harness
 * forwards raw agent-pool events straight through — the renderer reduces them
 * the same way in a terminal, an Electron window, or a browser tab.
