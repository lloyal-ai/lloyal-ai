/**
 * Your harness — the one file that's genuinely yours.
 *
 * It IS the platform contract: a headless generator `harness(ctx, events,
 * commands)`. `ctx` is the resident model; `events` streams your
 * `WorkflowEvent`s to whatever surface is mounted (terminal / Electron /
 * browser); `commands` delivers that surface's `Command`s back. The runtime,
 * the bindings, the targets, and the trust plumbing are conventions handled
 * for you — this file is where you program what your intelligence does.
 *
 * `basic` is deliberately the floor: two agents research a query in parallel
 * over a shared spine, a synth agent combines their notes. That's the whole
 * grammar in miniature — topology (`parallel`), a shared spine (`withSpine`),
 * a terminal tool (`report`), a reduce step (the synth). Replace it with your
 * own program; nothing else in the project needs to know what you wrote here.
