/**
 * The runner ↔ harness seam — your harness's edge substrate.
 *
 * `harness(ctx, events, commands)` reads `RunnerCtx` for the edge-shell concerns
 * it can't own: the live resolved config, config persistence, a model-reload
 * restart request, an observability trace sink, and the persistent wind-down /
 * cancel signals. A target's boot builds a `Runner` and sets `RunnerCtx` before
 * calling `harness`:
 *
 *   - cli   → {@link makeEdgeRunner}   (in-memory config, no-op reload, one boot)
 *   - web   → {@link makeServedRunner} (per-session, tenant-isolated)
 *
 * This is the SAME contract the reference `research` template and reasoning.run
 * use — so as your harness grows into config persistence, tracing, or graceful
 * wind-down, the seam is already here; you don't migrate to a different shape.
 *
 * The reranker is deliberately NOT a Runner concern: the boot's
 * `provisionAbilityModels` reads your enabled abilities' `services` and publishes the
 * reranker on `RerankerCtx`. So an ability that needs one just works, and the Runner
 * stays about the edge shell, not services.
 *
 * NOT a platform contract — `@lloyal-labs/host` speaks `ServedHarness`, never
 * `Runner`. This is your harness's private substrate.
