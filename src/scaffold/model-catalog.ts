 * A minimal, vendored copy of `@lloyal-labs/rig`'s model catalog — just the

 * `recommendedContext`), NOT the download URLs or digests (rig owns fetching +
 * verification; the CLI only offers the choice).
 *
 * It is vendored, not imported, on purpose: the catalog is only exported from
 * `@lloyal-labs/rig/node`, whose barrel also pulls in `createReranker` (the
 * NATIVE `@lloyal-labs/lloyal.node`) + the Ability registry. `lloyal` is the
 * Apache-2.0, zero-native-dep CLI — `verify.ts` duplicates rig's verify surface
 * for exactly this reason. Keep these rows in sync with rig's `MODEL_CATALOG`
 * (packages/rig/src/models.ts); adding a row here only widens the picker.
